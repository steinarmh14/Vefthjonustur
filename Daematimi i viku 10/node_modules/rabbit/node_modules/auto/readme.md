Asynchronous task runner for Node.js
Beta version - use at own risk.

## Basic Usage
Basic usage example.

```javascript
auto({

  // Get data, simulation as asynchornous operation
  get_data: [ function get_data( next, report ) {

    next( null, {
      name: 'Eric Flatley',
      username: 'Arnoldo_Lubowitz',
      email: 'Tyshawn@emie.biz',
      phone: '917.531.3079 x06115',
      website: 'donald.io'
    });

  }],

  // Create folder, which is an asynchronous operation
  make_folder: [ 'get_data', function make_folder( next, report ) {
    setTimeout( function() { next( null, 'folder created' ); }, 100 )
  }],

  // Write file once we have the data and folder is created
  write_file: ['get_data', 'make_folder', function write_file( next, report ) {
    setTimeout( function() { next( null, 'folder created' ); }, 200 )
  }],

  // Email Link once file is written
  email_link: ['write_file', function email_link( next, report ) {
    next( null, 'email sent' );
  }]

}).once( 'complete', console.log )
```

```javascript
app.get( '/test/:id', auto.middleware( tasks );
```

See the "express" example in the examples directory.
